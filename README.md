# PetCupid project

* I made an application whose purpose is to organize dog boarding houses.

* The application has a user system that asks for an email and password.

* A dog can be admitted to the boarding house and when he enters, his name and the number of days he has been there appear in the user's list

* Abandoned dogs can be put into a pen so other users can see them and choose to adopt them.

* This project uses the fireBase system for two purposes:
    1. Login with a password to the system
    2. Saving data so that the application is updated for all users live
